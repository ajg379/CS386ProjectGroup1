1. As a casual web user I want responsive web pages

    This feature is shown in how the page reacts to user input. When the user
    clicks the button to add a new instruction, new HTML elements are generated.
    The new elements even reflect the information included in the hardware json
    file.

2. As a microfluidic experiment designer I need to be able to write instructions
   for many different types of hardware

   This feature is shown in how the page adapts to whatever information is
   present in the Hardware.json file.

3. As an experiment designer, I want to be able to view all the instructions I
   am writing concurrently

   At the moment, you view all the instructions you are writing at the same time
   since when you click "Add New Instruction" it appends the new form below the
   current one instead of replacing it.

   NOTE: There is currently a bug where clicking "Add New Instruction" removes
   the inputs from the previous instructions. This is fixed in the most updated
   version, so don't worry about it

4. As a member of the Neptune project, I want the software associated with it to
   carry the Neptune branding.

   This is implemented by placing a header section at the top of the webpage
   containing the Neptune logo and primary color
