###Group:	James Beasley, Charles Beck, Charles Duso, Alexander Grzesiak, Erik Strauss
###Project Title:	Trident - BU Microfluid Experimentation Data Generator
###Course:	CS386 â€“ Spring 2017
###Instructor:	Professor Gerosa

###Introdution:
Our web application is to be used in research towards microfluidic experimentation being conducted at Boston University.
The application will allow researchers at Boston University to easily communicate instructions to the hardware they are 
developing for experimentation. At the core of the application it will be a web UI that allows users to create data structures,
and containing processes that will be executed by hardware. By introducing a selection interface that allows the user to choose
the hardware they wish to input to and the instructions they would like the hardware to perform, this product allows for more
in-depth approaches to microfluidic experiments.
