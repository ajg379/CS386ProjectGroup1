 - Make it not look so ugly (expand the CSS file)
 - Fix bug where adding a new instruction clears previous inputs
 - Place the JavaScript in its own file and link it
 - Thorough testing for bugs or inconsistencies
 - General code clean up. There is a lot of repeated code that could probably
   be condensed
