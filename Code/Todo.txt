Todo

 - Make it not look so ugly
 - Make it so that integer inputs can not be lower than zero
 - Find a way to link the JSON file so it does not have to be embedded
 - Add an "Add" button for committing an action to the instruction set
 - Have the "Add" button clear inputs when it is clicked
 - Thorough testing for bugs or inconsistencies
