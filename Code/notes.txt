- The signing in was tested on my localhost but whoever is hosting the website would just need to enter their
    host, username, aand password.
- The database would also need to be made but I just called it Vulcan
- The database only has User.  The SQL below can be run in your database to create the table in the database.

CREATE TABLE `user` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `first_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
  `last_name` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(128) NOT NULL,
  `pass` varchar(64) NOT NULL,
  `join_date` date NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
